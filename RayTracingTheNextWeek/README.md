## Ray Tracing: The Next Week

### TODO:

- Xcode cpp build settings
  - Bug: the executable file only work in the same directory as the image file, or it cannot read the image file. Now I don't understand why the image file didn't build as other .cpp or .h files. I'll record this question and try to resolve this bug later.
